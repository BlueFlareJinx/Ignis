# Ignis
Ignis is a lightweight application designed to give you precise control over your screen brightness. Unlike the default Windows functionality, which adjusts brightness in increments of 10%, this tool allows you to increase or decrease brightness by just 1%, offering greater precision and a more customizable user experience.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone :https://github.com/BlueFlareJinx/Ignis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Ignis
```

3. Run the installer to install Ignis:
```
py install.py
```

**After this, the application will automatically start when you restart your laptop.**

## Usage:
* Increase Brightness by 1%: ```Alt + Shift + a```
* Decrease Brightness by 1%: ```Alt + Shift + z```
